## Overview  
The **Sketch Match** system is a robust tool for sketch-based image retrieval and restoration. It operates in two primary stages:  

### 1. Image Matching  
- Utilizes **SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)** and **FLANN (Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbours)** for feature detection and matching key points between images.  
- Identifies the best match for a distorted or low-quality sketch from a predefined database of sketches.  

### 2. Image Restoration & Retrieval  
- Enhances distorted sketches using **CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization)** and **LAB color space adjustments**.  
- Matches the restored sketch with a database of original images to retrieve the correct image.

## Features  
- **Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR)** for sketch-based search.  
- Accurate feature detection and matching using SIFT and FLANN.  
- Robust image restoration techniques for distorted sketches.  
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics, including **SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)** and **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**.

## Applications  
1. **Forensics**: Identifying suspects or objects from rough sketches.  
2. **Art Restoration**: Recovering and matching historical sketches with their original works.  
3. **Creative Design**: Bridging sketches with digital imagery for inspiration or prototyping.

## Technical Highlights  

### Dataset  
- The **CUHK Face Sketch Database (CUFS)**, comprising 188 images and their corresponding sketches, served as the foundation for training and testing.  

### Methodology  
1. Distorted sketches were manually created and restored using CLAHE and LAB adjustments.  
2. Matches were refined with **RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus)** for accurate geometric transformations.  

### Performance Evaluation  
- **MSE** and **SSIM** metrics ensured restoration quality and visual fidelity.
